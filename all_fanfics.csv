It’s enough to make a person feel like they might actually deserve it. “And by it, you mean…?” he asks instead. Her huffed laugh of disbelief ruffles the hair at his neck. “Friendship, you idiot,” she answers. “And the general acquisition thereof.” Astarion cuts a sideways look at her as best he can with her still nestled so close. “And is that what we are? Friends?” He’d meant it to tease her, and yet finds that the silence before her answer twists his stomach.

A few words, sometimes a sentence or even two. The next words their soulmate will say to them. Usually, the first words they'll ever hear from their soulmate. Magnus never got a Soulmark. He's looked. Many times. At first he just assumed it was because of what he was, some byproduct of his freakishness. In his centuries, he's learned differently. Most immortals, most warlocks like him, they get Soulmarks the same time as everyone else. Sometimes they have to wait decades, centuries, to hear those words. Some of them find another Soulmark, decades after living a life with their first. But not Magnus.  Alec has never spoken a word. He can't. In a world where soulmates are connected by Soulmarks that show the first words the other will say to them, he wonders what this means for his soulmate."

Harry Potter merely sighed in exasperation and moved on. Death at thirty was not something he was entirely happy with, but he had lived a lot longer than he could have hoped for at fifteen years old. Waking up after was annoying, but in such a chaotic situation he could only roll with it.

It’s a volatile combination – he knows that fact too well. The Rookie of the Year and the Dead Last will be at each other’s throats, and the Top Kunoichi will be forced to mediate between the two. Only that’s not the case. Sakura is far too stab-happy when it comes to a certain Uchiha and has an odd fascination with longswords, silver, and diamonds. Sasuke loves insulting said Haruno before promptly getting his backside handed to him on a silver platter, not to mention his habits of setting himself on fire whilst fighting his ‘rival’. In fact, the only thing they ever agree on is a shared fear of fountains – of all things to be frightened of. Naruto is a wonderfully normal loudmouth of a dead last, despite the pranks. Kakashi likes normalcy."

The name marring her skin brings both hope and despair in equal measures, because her own name in that world is rarely spoken amongst those who remember it.

Still, it doesn’t stop her from longing for that elusive feeling which has escaped her in all three of her previous lives. Because there’s someone out there who’s meant to love her, and Sakura knows he’ll either do just that – or he’ll shatter her heart beyond repair."

One moment there’s nothing, the next there’s light. “Easy,” a woman says. Her words are gentle, and carry a slight accent that he can’t place. ""I'm called Wonder Woman. What's your name?"""

Having it at the Manor was, in hindsight, a really shitty idea. “I don’t have your phone!” The two boys began trading hits, yelling at the top of their lungs. Bruce turned back to the webcam just as Damian leapt on top of Tim’s back, a high-pitched battle cry torn from his lips. “Mr. Hodges,” he said cheerfully, unflinching as Tim threw Damian into the wet bar sink. “Have you had a chance to examine the chart I pointed out?” Inspired by this viral video and Batwayneman’s post on tumblr."

He'd take the wrath of Batman over live vivisection via beloved parents or being studied and torn apart by the government. Besides, he's not a meta. Being dead is a medical condition."

No, scratch that—Tim is great at galas. He’s been attending them ever since the age of three, when his parents first stuffed him into his little Gymboree tuxedo and gave him a stern lecture about ‘sitting quietly’ and ‘speaking when spoken to.’ He knows all the rules: what to wear, how to stand, when to smile, what to say, what not to say. He knows how to come across as polite and intelligent and charming, and on absolutely any other day, he would be rocking this. --- Or, my take on a ‘Tim Joins the Family Early’ AU, told through a series of sleepovers—most of which are unplanned.

Alfred would scoff at the statement, about how Bruce was trying to justify the whole situation to himself. It had started out as a simple design, black everything with black outlines and black hood. It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of The Bat . So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: “ The Batman can fly, you know, I’ve seen his wings.” -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything."

The other League members don't know this is a problem because they have no idea Batman has kids, much less that Nightwing is one of them.

It’s not her fault that she’s excitable, okay, and she forgets things sometimes and maybe those things should not be forgotten under any circumstances. Maybe those things include, well, housing forms, which as it turns out are super important to submit on time if she wants to not be homeless on her sophomore year of college.

A chance for that person to be safe from the destruction that Thanos was about to wrought on Earth. The group about to fight agreed that Peter Parker, for sheer virtual of being the only person not an adult there, would get the dubious honor. Which is how Peter finds himself waking up in Gotham City, a place even crueler and darker than New York City. Peter has to try to find a way to fit into this new universe at just sixteen years old. ""I am still just your butler, and I cannot simply tell you that you will be adopting a new son. But I truly am not getting younger.

His coffee sits untouched on the table, the way it does whenever he’s particularly excited about something, the way it will stay until he’s laid out the plan completely. “This one’s gonna be good.” “We’re going to steal the Declaration of Independence,” Ray whispers.)"

If anything, it just makes it worse, and Ryan is under the firm impression that no amount of skill with computers should warrant that level of smugness in a person. Even if that person also happens to be frustratingly attractive. Scratch that, especially if they also happen to be frustratingly attractive. Geoff asks Ryan to scare the kid into showing a little more humility, and he gladly complies. …His methods end up being something that Geoff probably didn't have in mind."

Unfortunately there’s a new criminal organization on the rise, and all attempts to infiltrate and take down the Padalecki family have failed so far.

Then again, Dean’s a little bit scared to ask exactly what Cas would want, just in case it doesn’t include spending quite so much time with him. And with Sam (of course). Sam’s been tracking a series of odd occurrences in Laramie, Wyoming for the last few weeks that looks just enough like a case to finally convince Dean they should go check it out. Whether they like it or not, the goddess responsible for the weirdness in Laramie takes an immediate interest in the three less-than-perfectly-happy hunters who’ve stumbled into her town."

Jensen nearly swallows his tongue when hot guy sidles up and says he'll pay double Jensen's going rate if he agrees to leave right the fuck now.

At least until a few months later when he realizes he may be in love with his one and only regular. Me again: Sorry, I tweaked it a bit and didn't quite work all the optional parts in."

The best part of it was watching Xiao Zhan laugh, too. His laugh was so genuine, coming out from the core of him. When he laughed his whole face lit up, his eyes crinkling, smile bright enough to shine out the sun. And Yibo’s heart just flopped over in his chest. It made him smile and laugh even louder, their laughter infectious. Yibo fell in love with that feeling. That wild joy that came from abandoning whether or not he looked cool and just giving in to the moment. 'I’ll do anything to keep him close to me,' Yibo thought, that very first day."

Ben and May divorced before Peter’s parents died, so when Ben is murdered Peter goes into foster care. It takes just a tiny taste of superpowers for Peter to decide he doesn’t want to put up with his horrible foster father anymore—the streets are infinitely more appealing. All he wants is to be Spider-Man anyway. So he leaves. Simple. Simple, that is, until Iron Man needs Spider-Man’s help. Peter isn’t about to turn down an opportunity to fight alongside Tony Freaking Stark, but he also isn’t going to let his hero know that his recruit is a fifteen-year-old homeless dropout.

Bruce comes to his aid, but he finds out that Billy is a 10-year-old homeless orphan with black hair and blue eyes. Obviously, he makes the only logical decision and adopts Billy. Because it's Bruce—who's allergic to revealing life-changing information—the League is left in the dark. This story is written as 5+1 story from the Justice League's POV as they attempt to define the weird relationship between Batman and Captain Marvel. 5 times they didn't realize Batman had adopted Captain Marvel, and the 1 time they did."

Alfred would scoff at the statement, about how Bruce was trying to justify the whole situation to himself. It had started out as a simple design, black everything with black outlines and black hood. It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of The Bat . So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: “ The Batman can fly, you know, I’ve seen his wings.” -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything."

The other League members don't know this is a problem because they have no idea Batman has kids, much less that Nightwing is one of them. Bruce decides to do the only reasonable thing: go on vacation. His children probably won't burn down anything too important. Dick just wants to defend his family and brag about his siblings. Good thing his father taught him a few things about the importance of detailed plans and talented allies."
Of Bats and Robins (and Families),MaskoftheRay,DC Extended Universe,https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031956,"9,672","Summary: “The Justice League knew that there was more to Bruce than he let on.

It’s not her fault that she’s excitable, okay, and she forgets things sometimes and maybe those things should not be forgotten under any circumstances. Maybe those things include, well, housing forms, which as it turns out are super important to submit on time if she wants to not be homeless on her sophomore year of college.

A chance for that person to be safe from the destruction that Thanos was about to wrought on Earth. The group about to fight agreed that Peter Parker, for sheer virtual of being the only person not an adult there, would get the dubious honor. Which is how Peter finds himself waking up in Gotham City, a place even crueler and darker than New York City. Peter has to try to find a way to fit into this new universe at just sixteen years old. ""I am still just your butler, and I cannot simply tell you that you will be adopting a new son. But I truly am not getting younger. You have seven children now, even if you haven’t adopted all of them legally. There is much more work than when it was just you and I. There is perhaps too much work for just myself, and then providence dropped a starving young man into my pathway for me to mold into a new generation of caretaker,” Alfred tried to explain himself.

Excerpt: ""Your prior hotel is no longer secure, I will direct you to a new location. Your luggage has already been transferred. A field agent and medic from the Diréction Générale de la Sécurité d'État will be waiting at the side entrance. I have cleared them both personally."" In contrast to his crisp dry English, Q's pronunciation of the French words was fluid and flawless, the throaty tone of the fricatives sending a surprising jolt of awareness straight to Bond's cock — all the more remarkable given his degree of blood loss. ""You're wasted on Q-branch, you have the voice for a phone-sex call-in line."" The words slipped out of Bond's mouth without forethought, although he had plenty of time to think in the sudden pause that came afterward and stretched on for endless moments.

i blinked (and there you were),Della19,Kingsman (Movies),https://archiveofourown.org/works/3589137,"10,364","Summary: The Weeping Angels, Eggsy reads on the stolen Torchwood intel. Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor’s chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it’s the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He’s lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ’til now - in the blink of an eye, and now he’s stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he’s even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he’s even there would be…20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry’d only be… Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can’t hold him. This is 1988, and Harry’s 23, and alive.

It's on his driver's licence. It's on his National Insurance card. Hell, it's even on his bloomin' GCSE certificates. And the fact that it's all a load of bollocks is a secret Eggsy had intended to take to his grave. Course, he hadn't been expectin' a bloody sub-drop to sweep in and knock him on his arse in the wake of the Valentine Massacre. Turns out grief and adrenaline ain't a good combination."
Lagavulin and Guinness,Snarfle,Kingsman (Movies),https://archiveofourown.org/works/4106295,"8,805","Summary: Plenty of people had looked down on Eggsy throughout his life. He had gotten fairly used to it. Didn't mean it was fair, but he knew how these things worked. What really sucked was that the new Arthur was worse than the old one. “Eggsy grimaced. He didn’t know how to explain to Harry – who seemed like he hadn’t been discriminated against a day in his life – that the new Arthur kept giving him what amounted to suicide missions, and that he was currently bleeding out in a warehouse because of the deliberately bad intel she had given him.” Also featuring: Dean is harder to get rid of than Eggsy thought, his mum is going off the deep end, there are way too many nefarious plots in play, and Eggsy is really beginning to wish that Harry would stop holding his hand and kiss him instead."

The Things Gentlemen Don’t Do,Della19,Kingsman (Movies),https://archiveofourown.org/works/3369206,"6,953","Summary: First rule of action movie logic; check the body. Because if you don’t check the body to make sure they’re really dead, then the rules of movie logic says you deserve the knife that ends up in your back when you turn around. A villain who was a little less squeamish of blood would have known that. Valentine doesn’t check the body, and Harry lives. This, perhaps unsurprisingly, creates a whole new set of problems for Eggsy, whose got a few…ungentleman-like urges when it comes to his mentor.

The guilt in his eyes is almost worse than the burning pain that's taking Peter apart piece by piece. The world starts to go dark. There's a flash of gold and green. For one moment, he finds himself standing amongst the Guardians and others. And then darkness again. It feels like blinking; an extended period of nothingness that ends as abruptly as it begins.

But Jack is agreeing with the Guardian of Hope, carrying obliviously onward. “Am I ever,” the boy says, fervently. “The 21st century’s great. You wouldn’t believe what people just throw out these days.” The admission comes like a wave striking rocks on a stony shore; it raises icy splashes of dread wherever its spray hits.

Some of them find another Soulmark, decades after living a life with their first. But not Magnus.  Alec has never spoken a word. He can't.

But he gets to work with his idols — Ghostbur, the Blade, and Philza Minecraft, Angel of Death himself, just to name a few — how could he turn down that opportunity, honestly?

Please? Just for one day. --- Okay, so maybe coming to the interview with a few broken ribs was a bad idea, but what choice did he have? Just not come and keep on being unemployed? Several bad things could happen during his interview, given the circumstances. There was an AI in the building designed by Vulcan which not only kept unwanted people from getting in, it scanned people for any unauthorized weapons or injuries. There was also the problem with his illegal documents since he wasn't an actual adult. But the biggest risk is that the job is at a hero organization. And he's a vigilante.

And we are fairly certain that the person who stole this thing of ours is in this very crowd.” Dream tensed beside Tommy as the crowd broke out into murmurs. Eyes were darting towards the different heroes in the crowd, the benefactors no doubt assuming that the culprit had to be a hero. “Like we said, we haven’t crashed your party to cause trouble. But we want this thing returned to us, and we won’t hesitate to take extreme measures to get what we want.” or, Tommy was a lot of things: a newly debuted hero sidekick, an amnesiac, and a former kidnapping victim of the Syndicate. Tommy didn't actually remember that last one though. That was just what Dream told him. Only weeks after his hero debut, the Syndicate announces they are searching for something, and Tommy knows it has to be him. The scariest part? If they find him, Tommy will have no clue what to expect, because the Syndicate might know him, but he has no memories of them. So he can't let them find him. No matter what. Of course they end up finding him anyway."
