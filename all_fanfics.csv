He‚Äôs the dead last, the failure at everything, so he doesn‚Äôt actually expect to succeed.

It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of The Bat . So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: ‚Äú The Batman can fly, you know, I‚Äôve seen his wings.‚Äù -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything."

Alfred would scoff at the statement, about how Bruce was trying to justify the whole situation to himself. It had started out as a simple design, black everything with black outlines and black hood. It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of The Bat . So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: ‚Äú The Batman can fly, you know, I‚Äôve seen his wings.‚Äù -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything."

Bruce decides to do the only reasonable thing: go on vacation. His children probably won't burn down anything too important. Dick just wants to defend his family and brag about his siblings.

It‚Äôs not her fault that she‚Äôs excitable, okay, and she forgets things sometimes and maybe those things should not be forgotten under any circumstances.

A chance for that person to be safe from the destruction that Thanos was about to wrought on Earth. The group about to fight agreed that Peter Parker, for sheer virtual of being the only person not an adult there, would get the dubious honor.

A voice called out from the doorway and Tommy grinned gleefully at the sight of his older brother. ""Dream!"" He yelled, stumbling out of bed and into his arms, hugging the man tight.

(For older Gaim fills please go here)  The speed at which I'm posting depends largely on whether or not I have time and whether or not my muse cooperates. Length will also vary - from drabble size to full length fic. I can do most Riders (starting from Den-O, haven't had the time to re-watch Kabuto yet or anything earlier than that) and a lot of the Sentai Series (MagiRanger onwards, no ToQger yet because I haven't gotten around to watching it but I have watched everything else but ToQger at this point, I guess...? Very much into Kyuranger and also watching Lupinranger vs Patoranger at the moment). I prefer non-het for smut prompts because to be quite honest, I really suck at writing straight stuff.

i blinked (and there you were),Della19,Kingsman (Movies),https://archiveofourown.org/works/3589137,"10,364","Summary: The Weeping Angels, Eggsy reads on the stolen Torchwood intel. Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor‚Äôs chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it‚Äôs the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He‚Äôs lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ‚Äôtil now - in the blink of an eye, and now he‚Äôs stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he‚Äôs even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he‚Äôs even there would be‚Ä¶20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry‚Äôd only be‚Ä¶ Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can‚Äôt hold him. This is 1988, and Harry‚Äôs 23, and alive.

It's on his driver's licence. It's on his National Insurance card. Hell, it's even on his bloomin' GCSE certificates. And the fact that it's all a load of bollocks is a secret Eggsy had intended to take to his grave. Course, he hadn't been expectin' a bloody sub-drop to sweep in and knock him on his arse in the wake of the Valentine Massacre. Turns out grief and adrenaline ain't a good combination."
Lagavulin and Guinness,Snarfle,Kingsman (Movies),https://archiveofourown.org/works/4106295,"8,805","Summary: Plenty of people had looked down on Eggsy throughout his life. He had gotten fairly used to it. Didn't mean it was fair, but he knew how these things worked. What really sucked was that the new Arthur was worse than the old one. ‚ÄúEggsy grimaced. He didn‚Äôt know how to explain to Harry ‚Äì who seemed like he hadn‚Äôt been discriminated against a day in his life ‚Äì that the new Arthur kept giving him what amounted to suicide missions, and that he was currently bleeding out in a warehouse because of the deliberately bad intel she had given him.‚Äù Also featuring: Dean is harder to get rid of than Eggsy thought, his mum is going off the deep end, there are way too many nefarious plots in play, and Eggsy is really beginning to wish that Harry would stop holding his hand and kiss him instead."

Because if you don‚Äôt check the body to make sure they‚Äôre really dead, then the rules of movie logic says you deserve the knife that ends up in your back when you turn around. A villain who was a little less squeamish of blood would have known that. Valentine doesn‚Äôt check the body, and Harry lives. This, perhaps unsurprisingly, creates a whole new set of problems for Eggsy, whose got a few‚Ä¶ungentleman-like urges when it comes to his mentor.

It‚Äôs the principle that held Tommy‚Äôs back straight and his shoulders broad through the years of hardships and trials of errors; through yet another formal meeting where his father‚Äôs gaze would look past him and where his brother‚Äôs words would be filled with poison that makes the deepest parts of his soul ache. At that time, Tommy couldn't know that his family would find a replacement for him in the face of a commoner boy named Ranboo. ~ü¶ã~ Tommy's family has replaced him.

After a hectic day of getting separated from Tubbo, getting into a few fights, and ending up in an entirely new town, he comes across Phil, and saves him from an assassination attempt by smashing a plate over someone's head. So then both Techno and Wilbur decide to see who this kid is, and Tommy sure is endearing, in the way that the first time they spy on him, he starts a fight in an alleyway over a bag of cookies.
