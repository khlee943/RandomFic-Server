That close already?"" “You don't want this,” she says simply, still out of breath, and for the first time since she’s met him, Astarion seems speechless. - auri knows people, and that's how she can tell; astarion is deeply, deeply fucked up."

The smell; blood below the skin and sweat sat on top of it. His tongue is out before he realizes, lapping over the area, dragging up any taste he can get. Tav’s other hand presses into the small of his back, arching Astarion into him, making him whine at the feeling of the cock shifting inside him, until Astarion’s chest is flush against Tav’s. “Feed.” When the Shadow-Cursed lands lack suitable prey, Astarion distracts himself from the hunger with sex until he can’t anymore."

You flick it over your knuckles, tounging at the back of your teeth as you allow your wrist to move with your flowing thoughts. You think of Astarion’s words from the first time you had caught him gazing into that broken mirror, fresh on your mind even if it feels like it’s been ages since you’d heard them.   “I want to know what the world sees when it looks at me. What you see.”  (Or, you draw Astarion to show him what he looks like.)"

If you were that desperate for approval—for the hard-earned praise of others—perhaps he could be the one to deliver. There were certainly plenty of benefits for him to reap. *** Preview: You looked so proud of yourself, drool pooling at the corners of your lust-drunk smile. Your hair was mussed and wild, but your expression was utterly tame, almost domestic. Astarion worried, momentarily, that he might actually end up being the one to crawl back to you. You made him feel so in control, so powerful. And so, so good."
"A Gift, A Curse",El_Emit,Baldur's Gate (Video Games),https://archiveofourown.org/works/51147769,"5,187","Summary: If the desperation in his eyes and the heartbreak on his face hadn’t already been enough to break you, the tremble in his voice would have done it. And even without all that, how could you ever say no to this man? He who stood beside you as you discovered your lost self. He who remained beside you when you learned your cursed history. He who bound the knots of your restraints and stroked your hair through the night, even as you writhed and fought to end his life. He helped you gain your freedom from the damnation of your birth.

i love a good place to hide (in plain sight),FlowerCitti,Baldur's Gate (Video Games),https://archiveofourown.org/works/49537924,"5,085","Summary: “What?” Astarion seems nearly speechless, his silver tongue gone heavy in his mouth as he blinks, coming damn close to outright stuttering, “I—I mean, surely you—I’ve seen how you look at me!” He huffs, looking frustrated and confused and completely thrown off. It’s almost endearing, to see him grow so flustered, his suave persona melting through his shock. You can’t help but smile, “I’m just not really interested in sex. That’s all.” You shrug, and Astarion looks at you as if that tadpole in your head has finally started to transform you.  (Or, you don’t want sex. Astarion doesn’t know what to make of that.)"

She squeezes him a little again. “That’s sort of how it works, Astarion.” She can’t even see it. Believes the best of them all so earnestly, himself included, that she can’t see how it would all fall away without her at the center. It’s enough to make a person feel like they might actually deserve it. “And by it, you mean…?” he asks instead. Her huffed laugh of disbelief ruffles the hair at his neck. “Friendship, you idiot,” she answers. “And the general acquisition thereof.” Astarion cuts a sideways look at her as best he can with her still nestled so close. “And is that what we are? Friends?” He’d meant it to tease her, and yet finds that the silence before her answer twists his stomach. Because…he doesn’t actually know, either. “Yes, Astarion,” Neve says gently, after a moment. “I think we’re very good friends.” - Neve and Astarion, continued. She's not a victim. Not a target. Not just one night it's better to forget. But then...whatever in the world could she be?"
