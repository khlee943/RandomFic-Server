If you were that desperate for approval—for the hard-earned praise of others—perhaps he could be the one to deliver. There were certainly plenty of benefits for him to reap. *** Preview: You looked so proud of yourself, drool pooling at the corners of your lust-drunk smile. Your hair was mussed and wild, but your expression was utterly tame, almost domestic. Astarion worried, momentarily, that he might actually end up being the one to crawl back to you.

And even without all that, how could you ever say no to this man? He who stood beside you as you discovered your lost self. He who remained beside you when you learned your cursed history. He who bound the knots of your restraints and stroked your hair through the night, even as you writhed and fought to end his life. He helped you gain your freedom from the damnation of your birth.

Enjoy the delicious taste of my 4am suffering. NB: This fic was written years ago, back when the canon details of certain characters' histories and personalities were either not specified or were explicitly different to the canon described in current lore. Much of the information I relied on when Oddfellows was written has been actively retconned, for example, but given that my writing and BHVR's writing are equally made up and thereby both equally real and equally fake, I don't feel the need to try to make Oddfellows fit with DBD's current lore.

Hubert is unusually cheerful, Byleth teaches the Blue Lions, and nobody has heard of the Flame Emperor. Instead, a figure known as the Hurricane King and his sinister cohort the Death Knight stalk the monastery. No sooner has Edelgard sought out this new world's Byleth than she finds herself standing in the eye of a storm of continent-spanning conspiracies centered on a young man with snow-white hair — one that will engulf Garreg Mach, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, the Adrestian Empire, and Edelgard's own family as it carries the roaring winds of war across Fodlan. A threat from a past so ancient it predates even Fodlan's oldest and murkiest myths is stirring, threatening to tear time itself asunder — and it may be her only way back home.","Teen And Up Audiences Graphic Depictions Of Violence Major Character Death F/F Gen Fire Emblem: Fuukasetsugetsu | Fire Emblem: Three Houses Edelgard von Hresvelg/My Unit | Byleth Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd & Edelgard von Hresvelg Ingrid Brandl Galatea & Edelgard von Hresvelg Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd/Marianne von Edmund Hapi & Edelgard von Hresvelg Blue Lions Students & Edelgard von Hresvelg Edelgard von Hresvelg & Edelgard von Hresvelg's Siblings Edelgard von Hresvelg & Claude von Riegan Edelgard von Hresvelg/Claude von Riegan Ingrid Brandl Galatea/Edelgard von Hresvelg Kronya/Ignatz Victor Edelgard von Hresvelg Edelgard von Hresvelg's Siblings Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd Black Eagles Students (Fire Emblem) Blue Lions Students (Fire Emblem) Those who Slither in the Dark (Fire Emblem) Glenn Fraldarius Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius Volkhard von Arundel Flayn (Fire Emblem) Seteth (Fire Emblem) Golden Deer Students (Fire Emblem) Ashen Wolves Students (Fire Emblem) Thales (Fire Emblem) Kronya (Fire Emblem) Solon (Fire Emblem) Cornelia Arnim Original Agarthan Characters Rhea (Fire Emblem) Sothis (Fire Emblem) Jeralt Reus Eisner Nemesis (Fire Emblem) Angst Pining Time Travel Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence Alternate Universe - Time Travel Dimitri has two Crests I call him ""Mayonnaise Dimitri"" Edelgard joins the Blue Lions Edelgard/Dimitri role swap... but only one way Pre-Timeskip | Academy Phase (Fire Emblem: Three Houses) Spoilers for Pre-Timeskip | Academy Phase (Fire Emblem: Three Houses) Spoilers for Post-Timeskip | War Phase (Fire Emblem: Three Houses) Paranoia It's Not Paranoia If They're Really Out To Get You Double Agents Triple Agents?

So, now he's to be assigned one, whether he likes it or not. Because his life is one grand, cosmic joke, his assigned 'caretaker' is none other than Veritas Ratio, a man whom he knows all-too-well.

Emperor Philza is always occupied; Tommy hasn’t seen Techno in months, and even if Wilbur is here, their relationship can be described to be strained at best. The royal family doesn’t need to be close, however, it only needs to be balanced, like the pillars holding the country above their heads – as long as they are strong and steady, the Empire will be too. It’s the principle that held Tommy’s back straight and his shoulders broad through the years of hardships and trials of errors; through yet another formal meeting where his father’s gaze would look past him and where his brother’s words would be filled with poison that makes the deepest parts of his soul ache. At that time, Tommy couldn't know that his family would find a replacement for him in the face of a commoner boy named Ranboo. ~🦋~ Tommy's family has replaced him.

Two ghosts haunted the mountain. One was the ghost of a young girl dressed in the uniform of the old Galaxy Team of the Hisuian age. She walks the mountain paths at dawn calling out for her father. The other ghost was a man with silver hair and silver eyes. He walks along the hiking trails at night calling out for someone named Akari. Anyone he runs into is asked the same question. “Please, have you seen my daughter? I can’t find her.” Upon being told no the ghost would continue on his way. Calling out for his child that he could never find. The ghosts of the father and child that haunted the mountain never to find each other was a popular sad tale in Sinnoh. It was also a popular subject for late night ghost hunting shows to cover for easy views.

Did Kamishiro think he could take on a rogue vampire in a fight? Vampires were strong, fast, with reflexes faster than light, it was superhuman. As far as Tsukasa could tell, Rui was human. No match for a feral rogue vampire. “Even so, I doubt the rogue vampire will dare show its face.” he stood proud as well. He knew they weren’t going to get attacked, or, well, he thought he knew. Some sort of gut feeling. “Well,” Kamishiro looked over to Tsukasa, smiling. “Let’s hurry to the plaza so you can eat your snacks.” Tsukasa smiled, but as soon as the feeling of safety filled him, a new, sharper sense of danger woke in the back of his head.

Believing the Sith were now extinct, the Jedi council convinced him to preserve himself for later generations. He was secretly frozen in carbonite and hidden away to be awoken if needed at a later date. His former padawan who was also his wife, learned of the plot and hatched her own to make sure the next time he was awoken, she’d be brought back too. 1000 years later, the Sith have returned in full force, stronger than ever and the Clone Wars are in full effect. On the verge of collapse, the Chancellor of the Republic begs the Jedi order to awaken their secret weapon. Not knowing he’s hoping to use the Chosen One against them, they begin searching for him. But all knowledge of his location seems to have been lost and their only hope of finding him lies with Ahsoka. Now that the powerhouse couple has been woken and reunited, will they be enough to stop the threat and save the galaxy one more time?

I'm going to do a flash fiction day at least once every month, and keep all the results here organized by date! If you wanna join in on next month's fun, come follow me on Twitter! Please keep in mind that these stories are extremely varied in kink, tone, and pairings. Some of them are romantic, some of them are hardcore and rough, and one of them literally has a naked Commander Shepard spreading dank memes. So...they're truly a bit of dirty chaos. I've decided to make a separate chapter for each, and the summary is a copy/paste of the actual prompt request that led to me writing it. Since all the chapter titles start with the franchise it's set in, should be easy to navigate to the smut you want!","Explicit No Archive Warnings Apply F/F F/M Multi Other M/M Avatar: The Last Airbender Avatar: Legend of Korra DC Animated Universe My Little Pony: Equestria Girls Dragon Age II Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) - All Media Types The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Street Fighter Borderlands Kill la Kill Marvel (Comics) Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon | Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Mass Effect Star Fox Series Super Smash Brothers Metroid Series Marvel vs. Capcom (Video Game) Darkstalkers (Video Games) DCU Steven Universe (Cartoon) Life is Strange (Video Game) Digimon - All Media Types Fallout 4 My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Daria (Cartoon) Original Work Teen Titans (Animated Series) The Legend of Zelda & Related Fandoms Frozen (2013) Overwatch (Video Game) RWBY Fire Emblem Series Shantae Dragon Age: Inquisition DCU (Comics) Mortal Kombat (Video Games) Neon Genesis Evangelion The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Final Fantasy XII Ghost in the Shell (2017) Fallout Shelter - Fandom Persona 5 Bayonetta (Video Games) Xena: Warrior Princess World of Warcraft Carmen Sandiego (Cartoon 2019) Toph Beifong/Katara Korra/Senna (Avatar) Lin Beifong & Opal Starfire/Terra Ms. Harshwhinny/Octavia Sonata Dusk/Aria Bethany Hawke/Female Hawke Riyo Chuchi/Barriss Offee Midna/Zelda Juri Han/Chun-Li Athena/Maya Kiryuuin Satsuki/Matoi Ryuuko Korra/Asami Sato Harley Quinn/Wade Wilson Poison Ivy/Harley Quinn Shuma Gorath/Morrigan Fox McCloud/Samus Aran Female Shepard/Liara T'Soni Female Shepard/Tali'Zorah nar Rayya Female Shepard/Liara T'Soni/Tali'Zorah nar Rayya Harleen Quinzel/Wade Wilson Maxine ""Max"" Caulfield/Kate Marsh Jane Lane/Daria Morgendorffer Daria Morgendorffer/Brittany Taylor Garnet/Peridot (Steven Universe) Link/Mipha (Legend of Zelda) Ganondorf & Link & Zelda Stephanie Brown/Cassandra Cain Kurusu Akira & Takemi Tae Daria Morgendorffer & Helen Morgendorffer Gabrielle/Xena Toph Beifong Katara (Avatar) Korra (Avatar) Senna (Avatar) Opal (Avatar) Lin Beifong Starfire Blackfire Terra Ms. Harshwhinny Octavia Sonata Dusk Aria Blaze Bethany Hawke Female Hawke Isabela (Dragon Age) Merrill (Dragon Age) Riyo Chuchi Barriss Offee Midna (Legend of Zelda) Zelda (Legend of Zelda) Juri Han Chun-Li Athena (Borderlands) Maya (Borderlands) Kiryuuin Satsuki Matoi Ryuuko Tali'Zorah nar Rayya Female Shepard (Mass Effect) Liara T'Soni Tenoh Haruka | Sailor Uranus Meiou Setsuna | Sailor Pluto Kaiou Michiru | Sailor Neptune Fox McCloud Samus Aran Morrigan Aensland Poison Ivy Wade Wilson Harleen Quinzel Jasper (Steven Universe) Garnet (Steven Universe) Peridot (Steven Universe) Daria Morgendorffer Jane Lane Brittany Taylor Maxine ""Max"" Caulfield Kate Marsh Makino Ruki | Rika Nonaka Twilight Sparkle Moondancer (My Little Pony) Sunset Shimmer Principal Abacus Cinch Fluttershy (My Little Pony) Link (Legend of Zelda) Ganondorf (Legend of Zelda) Mipha (Legend of Zelda) Souryuu Asuka Langley Rei Pearl (Steven Universe) Fran Vaan Flash Sentry Pinkie Pie Camilla (Fire Emblem) Lena ""Tracer"" Oxton Widowmaker | Amélie Lacroix Male My Unit | Avatar | Kamui | Corrin Cassandra Cain Stephanie Brown Kusanagi Motoko Helen Morgendorffer Kurusu Akira Takemi Tae Menat Rose (Street Fighter) Bayonetta (Bayonetta) Elena (Street Fighter) Urbosa (Legend of Zelda) Sakura Futaba Okumura Haru Xena (Xena) Gabrielle (Xena) Carmen Sandiego | Black Sheep Julia ""Jules"" Argent Sibling Incest Parent/Child Incest Futanari Incest Gangbang Oral Sex Vaginal Sex Anal Sex Impregnation Breeding dubcon Creampie Lesbian Sex Yuri Lesbian Character Short One Shot Flash Fic Aunt-Niece Relationship Aunt/Niece Incest foodplay Pregnancy Pregnant Sex Public Sex Embarassment Humiliation Humor Sexual Humor Double Penetration in One Hole Spitroasting Mindbreak Tentacle Sex Furry Threesome - F/F/M Threesome - F/F/F Strippers & Strip Clubs Stripping Sex Toys Cock Slut Cock Worship Frottage Tentacles femboy Threesome - F/M/M Comedy Master/Slave Implied/Referenced Rape/Non-con Implied Relationships Eggs Egg Laying Ass Play Butt Plugs Elevator Sex Curvy Women Cunnilingus Selfsuck Robots Scissoring Pegging Blindfolds Femdom Public Nudity Titjob Maids"

Fearsome tales told to all the children of the human kingdoms of Azeroth of satyr and wyvern and trolls and all the wild, fearsome things that once ruled the land.

Hidden away behind invisible barriers in a land of perpetual warmth and beauty. For the elves had tamed all things. Even nature, itself. The betrothal of Jaina Proudmoore, the first human with magic in her veins, to a Lord of the elven royalty was a convenient way for the humans to rid themselves of the perceived threat of a dangerous young woman with a gift none of them understood.
