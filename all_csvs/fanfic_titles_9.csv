Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor’s chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it’s the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He’s lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ’til now - in the blink of an eye, and now he’s stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he’s even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he’s even there would be…20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry’d only be… Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can’t hold him. This is 1988, and Harry’s 23, and alive. Suddenly, being stuck in 1988 doesn’t seem so bad. Or, the one where love means changing the future.

Call him a romantic, but he's not interested in hook ups and one night stands. He wants a relationship, with someone he can be his whole self with. And his true self is bi, and proud! Charlie is struggling with trust and control after an abusive relationship in high school shatters his self esteem. His therapist has suggested he needs to find a hobby that pushes at his limits of being in control. Charlie thinks Geoff probably meant joining a band, or maybe rock climbing, and not seducing fit guys, who are way out of his league, for one night stands. Same results though, so what's the harm? An aged up AU. Our two favourite boys are at the same Uni, but don't know each other yet. Until a chance encounter on a night out that ends up changing everything.

The momentum of her fall sends him thudding against a tree, and his eyes slam shut as he grits his teeth against the white hot pain that flares in his side. When he opens his eyes, she’s facedown in the snow, still and silent, hands still at her sides making it clear that she didn’t even try to catch herself. It speaks of so much trauma, so much unresponsiveness, that he feels tears sting his eyes at the sheer scale of what’s happened to her, of how small and useless he is to fix any of it, of how much he’s let her be hurt by his own failure to protect her. But there’s no time for his own self-loathing. She needs him, insufficient as he is.

The kind of being a Goblin can respect. So when the Girl-Who-Lived comes into the bank, Awakening…well. There’s little they could do to aid an underaged witch without a magical guardian. A Sentinel?

Suddenly, he is consumed by the need to locate the author, ascertain their wellbeing, and instruct them in the way of Vulcan mating bonds.

(Realizes that he’d moved, instinctively, to shield El, despite never having spoken to her, who’d the gun had been so precisely pointed at, aimed for.) Steve Harrington watches his own blood pool and trickle over a series of hands pressed against him, small and large, soft and rugged, and for a moment, wants to stay like this.

They stared at this strange spirit. It turned its back to them and Zuko was breathless at the show of disregard. Figures a spirit would not consider him a threat. He shouldn’t take it personally, but he’s been dismissed his whole life. He’s tired of it. A hand gripped his trembling one and he takes a breath. There is no use getting upset over the ways of a spirit. They both studied its small form and Zuko was caught by its profile. The spirit’s back held three repeating and somewhat glowing symbols.

They gathered their data through a symbiotic cycle with the local population and were well satisfied with the results. However, a third Entity attacked their Cycle, viewing the system as an aberration. Before being driven off, the one who would come to be known as Abaddon copied their data in the form of a bud. Unfortunately, the principles behind such protocols escaped him, and it was later traded to another known as the Thinker. During a certain accident, the Shard [Queen Administrator] absorbed the data, fascinated by what she found. The potential of such a device was amazing. Now all she needed was a host with attitude!
