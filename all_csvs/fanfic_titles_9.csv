Matt wishes that the Avenger's assumptions about his seeming inability to read the written word did something as benign as making an ass of him and them.

Communication when their comms are down - great plan! And including the local vigilante, who's been working closely with them on this, is a real no-brainer. Until it turns out said vigilante is an asshole that thinks sign language is beneath him, judging by the way he's stubbornly refusing to learn it.

The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor‚Äôs chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it‚Äôs the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He‚Äôs lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ‚Äôtil now - in the blink of an eye, and now he‚Äôs stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he‚Äôs even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he‚Äôs even there would be‚Ä¶20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry‚Äôd only be‚Ä¶ Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can‚Äôt hold him. This is 1988, and Harry‚Äôs 23, and alive. Suddenly, being stuck in 1988 doesn‚Äôt seem so bad. Or, the one where love means changing the future. Harry/Eggsy, Time Travel Fix-It."
