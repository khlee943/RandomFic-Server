A soft melodic voice that sang their mother's lullaby. A more monotonous, but just as loving voice that promised he'd teach him to fight one day, once he was old enough of course. The doting voice of a mother laughs with a toddler as she gently tries to fix a small crown onto the boy's brow. And then there was the gentle voice of a father, that promised to always keep him safe from those who'd do them harm. And in the morning when the boy would awake, he'd wonder who exactly he needed to be protected from. ""Tommy?"" A voice called out from the doorway and Tommy grinned gleefully at the sight of his older brother. ""Dream!"" He yelled, stumbling out of bed and into his arms, hugging the man tight. His brother returned the hug in kind, his hands pressing warmly into the spot on his back where his wings would ignite from for the first time in a few days, fully grown.

Adora is careful not to hug Catra too hard or make her feel restrained, anticipating the moment that Catra will start to pull away — but Catra doesn’t. She hangs on so tightly it hurts, her claws digging through Adora’s jacket and into her back, latching into her like she did when she was a kitten and didn’t know how much her claws could hurt. Adora tries not to wince, tries not to move a single muscle, worried that if she does the spell will break and Catra will struggle away, appalled at having shown weakness. But Catra doesn’t let go.

Though the twi’lek species lived on nearly as many planets throughout the galaxy as humans, their original homeworld remained relatively poor in wealth, if not population. Located at the intersection of two hyperlanes, one of which was the far-reaching Corellian Run that went all the way up into the Core, Ryloth’s greatest assets were her spaceports, and her people. Hence the regular raids, when crews made up of the worst sort of scum sought to turn a quick profit, by kidnapping as many twi’leks as they could before high-tailing it to the nearest slave markets. The people of course developed what defensive tactics they could: towns built within canyons, clan homes carved into mountain sides, some families living nomadically across the desert expanses.

They were never supposed to happen and the evil being behind what forces manipulated the Clone Wars into existing was never meant to survive long enough to do much of anything significant. At the End of Ahsoka's days, she is offered a choice by the Mother: to take the rest she so thoroughly deserves, or to go back to the section of History that should never have happened to go through it all to the end again, this time armed with enough foreknowledge to even out the odds of the rigged game. It's never even half a question for her, so when she accepts, she's given yet another gift, the chance to ask the same of her dearest friends... Year 1 covers the events of 22BBY from Christophsis to Skytop Station. (Events including Teth, Naboo, Maridun, Abregado, and Rishi Outpost) Also, this IS a Rexsoka endgame, but it's very slow burn and most of it can easily be read as nothing more than a close friendship, if you so chose, and it has plenty of special-connection drama between multiple other variations of the most popular Clone Wars pairings.

So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: “ The Batman can fly, you know, I’ve seen his wings.” -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything.",Mature No Archive Warnings Apply M/M Batman - All Media Types Superman - All Media Types DC Extended Universe DCU Clark Kent/Bruce Wayne Dick Grayson & Bruce Wayne Jason Todd & Bruce Wayne Tim Drake & Bruce Wayne Dick Grayson & Jason Todd Tim Drake & Jason Todd Clark Kent Bruce Wayne Dick Grayson Jason Todd Tim Drake Alfred Pennyworth Louis Lane Tim Drake's Parents Diana (Wonder Woman) Damian Wayne Wings Wingfic Adopted Sibling Relationship Sibling Bonding Identity Reveal Secret Identity Headcanon this got out of hand i wanted to write wingfic and failed to do that correctly so now this is a monster Fluff and Humor Fluff and Angst Hurt/Comfort Everyone Needs A Hug Slow Burn Alternate Universe Good Sibling Jason Todd Good Sibling Dick Grayson Good Sibling Tim Drake Alternate Universe - Everyone Lives/Nobody Dies Alternate Universe - Wings But not like you're thinking

Emma will do anything to win the million—except trust her opponents, or even her allies. Competing mostly for fun, Kitty wishes her sister would let her walls down, as she’s tired of how Emma’s been treating her since her bad breakup.
