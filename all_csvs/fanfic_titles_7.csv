It’s their source of powers as minor deities, after all. Grian, who wanted nothing more than to forget his Watcher past, was quite happy not to be worshipped at all. So when the Hermits collectively started praying to Xelqua and Grian started to gain a lot of Watcher magic, it put a real damper on his mood, health, self-perception and his relationships. With Mumbo gone off-world, it was now up to Scar, Pearl and Xisuma to worry about him – if Grian would let them. But Grian was nothing if not stubborn. He’d get through this alone, right? ..Right?"

A servant of a respected noble family. A survivor, with bruises on his skin and hidden wings tied down to his back. A rebel, sneaking away for a night of wonder in the heart of the kingdom - and a curiosity, gawked at by all as the King himself swept him into his arms and spent hours by his side. When Scar spent days tracking Grian down and helping him escape the cruel grasp of the Watchers, Grian thought his life couldn’t surprise him anymore. Pledging his life to serve Scar was all he could do to thank his King. Of course, being the personal servant of the King comes with its' own risks - and now Grian could add ‘hostage’ to his list of titles. Or; someone decides kidnapping King Scar’s beloved servant was a good idea. It really wasn’t."

They rush forward, eating the distance between them in rapid strides, until they're all crouched around Grian. Grian shuts his eyes again, before remembering he isn't supposed to do that. He wants to say sorry. What he says instead, is: ""It was– safer. Like this. For you."" It amounts to about the same thing. Or, I finally buckle down and post the rough draft of hunger au, where I give Grian every mental illness known to man and also a few new ones. Please heed the tags."

Siren snorted. “No. I’m just here to order some food.” “Wh-What about him?” The cashier asked, glancing at Tommy. “Did you- did you kidnap him?” “I mean… yeah, let’s go with that in case this ends up on the news,” Siren shrugged, looking back at Tommy. “I kidnapped you, right?” “Yeah, sure,” Tommy agreed, knowing that if they said he was kidnapped, it would keep people from getting suspicious of why he was seen in public with Siren. “Anyway, can I get the chicken nuggets happy meal, with a coke?” or, how Tommy—who is not a hero, or a villain, or even a vigilante—saves the life of one of L'Manberg's most feared supervillains, and accidentally ends up becoming the resident doctor for every supervillain in town (and maybe gets a family along the way too)."
Butterfly Reign,SilentTeyz,Dream SMP,https://archiveofourown.org/works/34743979,"35,605","Summary: The royal family of Antarctic empire isn’t exactly close. Emperor Philza is always occupied; Tommy hasn’t seen Techno in months, and even if Wilbur is here, their relationship can be described to be strained at best. The royal family doesn’t need to be close, however, it only needs to be balanced, like the pillars holding the country above their heads – as long as they are strong and steady, the Empire will be too. It’s the principle that held Tommy’s back straight and his shoulders broad through the years of hardships and trials of errors; through yet another formal meeting where his father’s gaze would look past him and where his brother’s words would be filled with poison that makes the deepest parts of his soul ache. At that time, Tommy couldn't know that his family would find a replacement for him in the face of a commoner boy named Ranboo. ~🦋~ Tommy's family has replaced him. It's only fair that he gets to do the same."

Tommy, sixteen, lives with Tubbo in an orphanage, the two of them running around in the cold streets of their town. After a hectic day of getting separated from Tubbo, getting into a few fights, and ending up in an entirely new town, he comes across Phil, and saves him from an assassination attempt by smashing a plate over someone's head. So then both Techno and Wilbur decide to see who this kid is, and Tommy sure is endearing, in the way that the first time they spy on him, he starts a fight in an alleyway over a bag of cookies. (and then Tommy basically gets kidnapped into the royal family, but like, legally, y’know?) [There is now a sircantus discord! For the sircantus enjoyers https://discord.gg/pHGgJ9rmGv ]"

Several bad things could happen during his interview, given the circumstances. There was an AI in the building designed by Vulcan which not only kept unwanted people from getting in, it scanned people for any unauthorized weapons or injuries.

And we are fairly certain that the person who stole this thing of ours is in this very crowd.” Dream tensed beside Tommy as the crowd broke out into murmurs. Eyes were darting towards the different heroes in the crowd, the benefactors no doubt assuming that the culprit had to be a hero. “Like we said, we haven’t crashed your party to cause trouble. But we want this thing returned to us, and we won’t hesitate to take extreme measures to get what we want.” or, Tommy was a lot of things: a newly debuted hero sidekick, an amnesiac, and a former kidnapping victim of the Syndicate. Tommy didn't actually remember that last one though. That was just what Dream told him. Only weeks after his hero debut, the Syndicate announces they are searching for something, and Tommy knows it has to be him. The scariest part? If they find him, Tommy will have no clue what to expect, because the Syndicate might know him, but he has no memories of them. So he can't let them find him. No matter what.

It wasn’t particularly passionate or chaste, but somewhere in the middle– careful. Vox knew Shoto wasn’t his, but that they also weren’t uncommitted. Vox was kissing him not as a friend, or as an omega; he was kissing him as Shoto. When the kiss reached its end, Shoto was more confused than ever. He didn’t know which side was in control anymore, because what they had just experienced– it had simply felt right."
