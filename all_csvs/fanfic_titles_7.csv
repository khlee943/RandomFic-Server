It’s their source of powers as minor deities, after all. Grian, who wanted nothing more than to forget his Watcher past, was quite happy not to be worshipped at all. So when the Hermits collectively started praying to Xelqua and Grian started to gain a lot of Watcher magic, it put a real damper on his mood, health, self-perception and his relationships. With Mumbo gone off-world, it was now up to Scar, Pearl and Xisuma to worry about him – if Grian would let them. But Grian was nothing if not stubborn.

A servant of a respected noble family. A survivor, with bruises on his skin and hidden wings tied down to his back. A rebel, sneaking away for a night of wonder in the heart of the kingdom - and a curiosity, gawked at by all as the King himself swept him into his arms and spent hours by his side. When Scar spent days tracking Grian down and helping him escape the cruel grasp of the Watchers, Grian thought his life couldn’t surprise him anymore. Pledging his life to serve Scar was all he could do to thank his King. Of course, being the personal servant of the King comes with its' own risks - and now Grian could add ‘hostage’ to his list of titles. Or; someone decides kidnapping King Scar’s beloved servant was a good idea.

Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor’s chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it’s the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He’s lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ’til now - in the blink of an eye, and now he’s stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he’s even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he’s even there would be…20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry’d only be… Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can’t hold him. This is 1988, and Harry’s 23, and alive. Suddenly, being stuck in 1988 doesn’t seem so bad. Or, the one where love means changing the future.

You did everything right; you lived your life just as Christianity told you to! So why were you there, and not in Heaven? Even if Heaven didn't seem to be as perfect as everyone prophesized it to be in life... Hell, it's still bad, it's still a place of evil, chaos and drugs and sex and sin. Ironically, it's not much different from Earth in some ways... The streets reek of booze, sex and blood, but even Hell can have a silver lining to it, you've realized... Lucifer Morningstar, that smug, prideful, handsome angel/demon man is sin himself in every possible way that a man can be. The very instinct someone should have upon hearing his name should be to turn tail and run. But you understand now why Eve was so tempted by him in the garden. The angel who first fell from Heaven could make any human fall to their knees for him with just how tempting he is... So, why... why does he lure you in like a moth to a flame? Why does this man with a painful past who gave up on your fellow sinners cast temptation on you so easily?

Everyone expected him to be overthrown almost immediately, but he has only grown ever more secure in his position. Finally, the other countries around Kaedwen have begun to negotiate with him as they would any other king. To seal the new treaty between Redania and the Warlord, Lady Milena de Roggeven, third daughter of the Duke of Roggeven, has been sent to marry whichever of the Warlord’s men he chooses. Milena is starkly terrified of everything about her new husband; every rumor she has ever heard about the barbarians of the north seems worse than the last, and Lambert clearly despises the very thought of marriage. Lambert of the Wolves is still grieving his lost lover, dead more than three years now.

When he looked at John, his friend was already looking at him. And suddenly, it all became clear: He remembered having that conversation more than 50 years ago. He remembered it too well. He had been thinking about it for years, wondering what he should have understood, how he should have reacted. If it was as meaningful as it had felt or if his memory had just romanticized it. “I don’t think a love like that obeys to any rules,” John went on, unaware of Paul’s agitation. “It’s not something that humans have created, not like a societal thing. It’s deeper than that, and that’s what some people are afraid of I guess, because they can’t control it. Whatever laws they create, they can never control it. A white lad will fall in love with a black girl.” He paused. “A lad with another lad. You know.” -- Summer 2019, 77-year-old Paul wakes up feeling surprisingly good.
