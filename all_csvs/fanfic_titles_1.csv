He‚Äôs the dead last, the failure at everything, so he doesn‚Äôt actually expect to succeed. And when he‚Äôs suddenly standing, knee deep in murky water and face to face with a demon, he has no idea what to expect. As it turns out, the world could use something unexpected.  In which Naruto discovers the real meaning of the word monster, Sasuke discovers power and strength and learns the difference between them, and Sakura discovers that being herself is not as selfish as she thought.
