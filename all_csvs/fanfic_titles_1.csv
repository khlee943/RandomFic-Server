Some of them are romantic, some of them are hardcore and rough, and one of them literally has a naked Commander Shepard spreading dank memes. So...they're truly a bit of dirty chaos.

All at once, Xanxus had everything he'd wanted as a child. A home. A family. Stability. And he was going to fight like hell and beat down anyone who tried to take it from him, no matter what his age. (In which Sakumo raises a son who speaks multiple languages from birth, all of them gibberish to the poor single father jounin, spits vulgarity with the same ease as he does his praise and burns with an unshakable determination to build himself a family that will not fall, no matter who or what is thrown against it.)",Mature No Archive Warnings Apply F/F M/M Katekyou Hitman Reborn!

He stops dead on the pavement, grips Mob by the shoulders, and stares down into his eyes with an expression as haunted as though every ghost the pair of them has ever exorcised has taken up residence behind it. “Mob,” he says. “Mob,” he says again. “Tell me, Mob. Look at me and tell me. Tell me truthfully. Do I look cursed to you?” Mob looks at him, and tells him truthfully. “No.” “Well, you didn’t look very long,” says Reigen. “Let’s just stand here for a moment, like so, and you can have another look, a nice long look, and really think about it...” (There's nothing strange about being called back to exorcise the same haunted photocopier six days in a row.

Of Harrowed Hearts,Sable_Scribe,Naruto,https://archiveofourown.org/works/8211566,"32,543","Summary: Sometimes the hardest battle isn’t enough to change a heart, sometimes all the war and blood in the world isn’t enough to shift a single destiny. Sometimes a simple touch is enough to break down the strongest of barriers, sometimes a single word is enough to make the world quake. Sometimes the most reaching of changes comes in the form of a little boy sad enough, strong enough, and kind enough to make friends with a monster. Sometimes one change makes waves.  Naruto has been hearing the rumbling growl in the back of his head for as long as he can remember. He’s seven when he tries to talk to it for the first time. He’s the dead last, the failure at everything, so he doesn’t actually expect to succeed. And when he’s suddenly standing, knee deep in murky water and face to face with a demon, he has no idea what to expect. As it turns out, the world could use something unexpected.  In which Naruto discovers the real meaning of the word monster, Sasuke discovers power and strength and learns the difference between them, and Sakura discovers that being herself is not as selfish as she thought.

Sasuke was still an idiot, but they were mostly getting over that. Everyone else was just trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy in the era after facing the Juubi and losing so much. Hatake Kakashi never wanted to be Hokage, but that's what he became. With that comes enemies. During an ambush, Naruto jumps in front of a jutsu that would tear his former sensei's soul from his body. The jutsu begins to tear Kurama away instead. In a desperate bid to save both his and Naruto's life, Kurama does something almost as unpredictable as his host. He tries to send them back in time a day. This would have worked fine, except Kurama might have...overshot things a bit. Oh, wow, is that a chibi Naruto running around? What year is it again?

Some of them are romantic, some of them are hardcore and rough, and one of them literally has a naked Commander Shepard spreading dank memes. So...they're truly a bit of dirty chaos. I've decided to make a separate chapter for each, and the summary is a copy/paste of the actual prompt request that led to me writing it.

It had been 4 years since Emmet looked at himself in the mirror, or even passed one, the jolt of wondering if he’d seen his twin too much to bear. 3 years, since the battle subway had removed multi battles and limited its single and double battles, as Emmet stretched himself too thin working. 2 years, since Emmet became the only person to believe his brother was alive. It took a single year for Emmet to become quieter, fueled by his words or phrases failing to produce his twin’s response. But after those 5 long years of not knowing what had happened to Ingo, from within a part of the unused tunnels of the battle subway, a strange Sneasel-like Pokémon suddenly appears from the dark within Emmet’s personal space in the blink of an eye.

Two ghosts haunted the mountain. One was the ghost of a young girl dressed in the uniform of the old Galaxy Team of the Hisuian age. She walks the mountain paths at dawn calling out for her father. The other ghost was a man with silver hair and silver eyes. He walks along the hiking trails at night calling out for someone named Akari. Anyone he runs into is asked the same question. “Please, have you seen my daughter? I can’t find her.” Upon being told no the ghost would continue on his way. Calling out for his child that he could never find. The ghosts of the father and child that haunted the mountain never to find each other was a popular sad tale in Sinnoh. It was also a popular subject for late night ghost hunting shows to cover for easy views. A cheap budget ghost hunting show isn’t how Emmet should learn that his missing brother is dead and haunting a mountain in a far off region, but it is and that one show causes Emmet to drag Elesa with him to Sinnoh to find answers.",Teen And Up Audiences Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings Gen Pocket Monsters | Pokemon - All Media Types Pokemon Legends: Arceus (Video Game) Pocket Monsters | Pokemon (Main Video Game Series) Pocket Monsters: Black & White | Pokemon Black and White Versions Pocket Monsters: Black 2 & White 2 | Pokemon Black 2 & White 2 Versions Nobori | Ingo & Shou | Akari Kamitsure | Elesa & Nobori | Ingo Kamitsure | Elesa & Shou | Akari Kamitsure | Elesa & Kudari | Emmet Kudari | Emmet & Shou | Akari Kamitsure | Elesa & Kudari | Emmet & Nobori | Ingo Kudari | Emmet & Nobori | Ingo Shou | Akari Nobori | Ingo Kudari | Emmet Kamitsure | Elesa Volo (Pokemon) Mikaruge | Spiritomb Giratina (Pokemon) Nobori no Chandela | Ingo's Chandelure Suzuna | Candice Angst with a Happy Ending Ghosts Emmet isn't having a good time Ingo isn't having a good time Elesa isn't having a good time Akari isn't having a good time No one is having a good time Temporary Character Death Curses Volo is a jerk Angst and Hurt/Comfort dad ingo Ingo adopts Akari Adoption Found Family Nobori | Ingo is a Dad ingo is akari's dad Father-Daughter Relationship Time Travel Ghost Stories Family Reunions Akari is not Dawn Family Feels Emmet is going to brawl every single legendary Pokémon in Sinnoh if he has to Angst Fluff and Angst Emmet and Elesa's road trip through Sinnoh Uncle Emmet Aunt Elesa Younger Akari
