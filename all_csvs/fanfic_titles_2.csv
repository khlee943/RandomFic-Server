""Have you ever explicitly told him what you want?” “Neil knows what I want,” Andrew snaps. This is not Andrew’s fault. “How do you know?” Because Neil always knows. He is as fluent in Andrew’s micro-expressions as he is in German and French. He knows which head tilts mean “go on” and which ones mean “shut up.” Without ever asking, he learned what it meant to see Andrew wearing double layers of long sleeves, or taking multiple showers in a day, and learned to hand Andrew the car keys. That has always been the most terrifying thing about Neil — his patience to wait, watch, listen, learn. The prospect that if Neil were given enough time, there would be no part of Andrew that was just Andrew’s anymore. “He has to know,” Andrew says. “Does he?” Renee says. “Have you ever known Neil to assume that he is wanted?” Five times Neil tells someone that he and Andrew aren’t dating, and one time Andrew uses his words to set the record straight.",Not Rated Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings M/M All For The Game - Nora Sakavic Neil Josten/Andrew Minyard Neil Josten Andrew Minyard Nicky Hemmick Aaron Minyard Kevin Day Renee Walker (All For The Game) content warnings for all the canon-typical trauma 5 Things Post-Canon Developing Relationship andrew's pov Neil learning how to be people Fluff and Angst Emotional Hurt/Comfort Angst with a Happy Ending please do not copy

She did not believe lions were kind, but she always remembered a bow in her schoolgirl hands. She looked in every old wardrobe she came across. It was casual, everyday– the first day in a new lecture hall, she checked the back of the coat closet. Friends had her over for Christmas dinner and she excused herself to go the bathroom, checked every cabinet and closet, and then headed back in for pudding. She went home with a cute boy she met in a smoky little pub and she checked his wardrobe before she headed home the next morning, heels in hand. She also went to college, got a political science degree she had to fight for. She got a byline in the local paper, a few ladies’ magazines, then a larger regional publication. She had mimosa brunches with friends. She read detective novels, never touched fantasy, and finally one day she stepped through an old stone archway barely thinking about it and–- She was standing in a treeless plain, all yellow grass and blue blue skies.

There were certainly plenty of benefits for him to reap. *** Preview: You looked so proud of yourself, drool pooling at the corners of your lust-drunk smile. Your hair was mussed and wild, but your expression was utterly tame, almost domestic. Astarion worried, momentarily, that he might actually end up being the one to crawl back to you.

If you were that desperate for approval—for the hard-earned praise of others—perhaps he could be the one to deliver. There were certainly plenty of benefits for him to reap. *** Preview: You looked so proud of yourself, drool pooling at the corners of your lust-drunk smile.

It’s almost endearing, to see him grow so flustered, his suave persona melting through his shock. You can’t help but smile, “I’m just not really interested in sex.

It’s enough to make a person feel like they might actually deserve it. “And by it, you mean…?” he asks instead. Her huffed laugh of disbelief ruffles the hair at his neck. “Friendship, you idiot,” she answers. “And the general acquisition thereof.” Astarion cuts a sideways look at her as best he can with her still nestled so close. “And is that what we are? Friends?” He’d meant it to tease her, and yet finds that the silence before her answer twists his stomach. Because…he doesn’t actually know, either. “Yes, Astarion,” Neve says gently, after a moment. “I think we’re very good friends.” - Neve and Astarion, continued. She's not a victim. Not a target.

It was casual, everyday– the first day in a new lecture hall, she checked the back of the coat closet. Friends had her over for Christmas dinner and she excused herself to go the bathroom, checked every cabinet and closet, and then headed back in for pudding. She went home with a cute boy she met in a smoky little pub and she checked his wardrobe before she headed home the next morning, heels in hand. She also went to college, got a political science degree she had to fight for. She got a byline in the local paper, a few ladies’ magazines, then a larger regional publication. She had mimosa brunches with friends. She read detective novels, never touched fantasy, and finally one day she stepped through an old stone archway barely thinking about it and–- She was standing in a treeless plain, all yellow grass and blue blue skies.

What was once broken now harms. Like the glass itself is fighting back against the one who dared hurt it. Sharp edges that cut and draw blood. Despite being broken, it refuses to be cowed and used its own broken pieces to fight back. That describes Cale Henituse perfectly. Fragile. Weak.

A few words, sometimes a sentence or even two. The next words their soulmate will say to them. Usually, the first words they'll ever hear from their soulmate. Magnus never got a Soulmark. He's looked. Many times. At first he just assumed it was because of what he was, some byproduct of his freakishness. In his centuries, he's learned differently. Most immortals, most warlocks like him, they get Soulmarks the same time as everyone else. Sometimes they have to wait decades, centuries, to hear those words. Some of them find another Soulmark, decades after living a life with their first. But not Magnus.  Alec has never spoken a word. He can't.

There was nothing left for him in the wizarding world so he was starting over. Harry Black, a 17-year-old muggle with too much time on his hands, moves to the only place where he might still have family. Forks, Washington, seems like the perfect place to start over and carve out a new place for himself but he's not the only immortal teenager in town and ignoring the problem doesn't seem to be making it go away. He didn't need to get involved with every supernatural mystery, and really, was it any of his business if his new cousin's eyes glowed amber sometimes? It certainly wasn't any of his business that a coven of vampires were pretending to be teenagers at his school. Harry is determined to ignore what's happening and instead focus on his hatred of Charles Dickens, Chemistry homework and Mike Newton. But the supernatural element of his new high school can't seem to leave him alone and Harry has always been really bad at staying out of things. ---- Follow my Tumblr for updates on this fic and everything else I'm working on!",Mature No Archive Warnings Apply Graphic Depictions Of Violence F/M M/M Harry Potter - J.

If only he could figure out how to deserve it. (This is a low, slow exploration of trauma, recovery, and learning to live with oneself. BDSM is the lens through which all that is explored, but this is not a story based around sexual encounters.
