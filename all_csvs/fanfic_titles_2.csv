""Have you ever explicitly told him what you want?” “Neil knows what I want,” Andrew snaps. This is not Andrew’s fault. “How do you know?” Because Neil always knows. He is as fluent in Andrew’s micro-expressions as he is in German and French. He knows which head tilts mean “go on” and which ones mean “shut up.” Without ever asking, he learned what it meant to see Andrew wearing double layers of long sleeves, or taking multiple showers in a day, and learned to hand Andrew the car keys. That has always been the most terrifying thing about Neil — his patience to wait, watch, listen, learn. The prospect that if Neil were given enough time, there would be no part of Andrew that was just Andrew’s anymore. “He has to know,” Andrew says. “Does he?” Renee says. “Have you ever known Neil to assume that he is wanted?” Five times Neil tells someone that he and Andrew aren’t dating, and one time Andrew uses his words to set the record straight."

It's not that I can't spell, or that I'm perversely writing him out of character - I incorporated other characters from Arthurian legend (Kay, Gawain etc) into my story, and lacking prophetic abilities, my versions naturally don't mesh with the versions subsequently introduced into the show.::"

It’s enough to make a person feel like they might actually deserve it. “And by it, you mean…?” he asks instead. Her huffed laugh of disbelief ruffles the hair at his neck. “Friendship, you idiot,” she answers. “And the general acquisition thereof.” Astarion cuts a sideways look at her as best he can with her still nestled so close. “And is that what we are?

Sasuke loves insulting said Haruno before promptly getting his backside handed to him on a silver platter, not to mention his habits of setting himself on fire whilst fighting his ‘rival’. In fact, the only thing they ever agree on is a shared fear of fountains – of all things to be frightened of. Naruto is a wonderfully normal loudmouth of a dead last, despite the pranks.
