It’s their source of powers as minor deities, after all. Grian, who wanted nothing more than to forget his Watcher past, was quite happy not to be worshipped at all. So when the Hermits collectively started praying to Xelqua and Grian started to gain a lot of Watcher magic, it put a real damper on his mood, health, self-perception and his relationships. With Mumbo gone off-world, it was now up to Scar, Pearl and Xisuma to worry about him – if Grian would let them. But Grian was nothing if not stubborn.

A servant of a respected noble family. A survivor, with bruises on his skin and hidden wings tied down to his back. A rebel, sneaking away for a night of wonder in the heart of the kingdom - and a curiosity, gawked at by all as the King himself swept him into his arms and spent hours by his side. When Scar spent days tracking Grian down and helping him escape the cruel grasp of the Watchers, Grian thought his life couldn’t surprise him anymore. Pledging his life to serve Scar was all he could do to thank his King. Of course, being the personal servant of the King comes with its' own risks - and now Grian could add ‘hostage’ to his list of titles. Or; someone decides kidnapping King Scar’s beloved servant was a good idea.

Scar didn't know about avian courtship ritual. He didn't. Grian knew that he didn't know. So if he didn't, why was he doing every ritual so perfectly? {In which Scar stumbles ass-backward into performing all 5 of the typical avian courtship gestures in his attempts at wooing Grian, Grian is desperately trying to convince himself he's still in the friend zone, Jimmy's busy having his own relationship crisis, and Pearl will meddle all she needs if it'll get these idiots together already.}",Teen And Up Audiences No Archive Warnings Apply M/M Hermitcraft SMP 3rd Life | Last Life SMP Series Empires SMP Charles | Grian/Ryan | GoodTimesWithScar Charles | Grian Ryan | GoodTimesWithScar Pearl | PearlescentMoon Jimmy | Solidarity Scott Major | Smajor1995 Alternate Universe - Superheroes/Superpowers Hybrids Bird/Human Hybrids Alternate Universe - Mutants Charles | Grian and Pearl | PearlescentMoon are Siblings Jimmy and Grian are cousins 5+1 Things Cute Flirting Courtship Denial of Feelings Panic Attacks Discrimination (Hybrids and Mutants are Discriminated against) Music Alternate Universe - Professors Flying Secret Identity Hurt/Comfort Disability Physical Disability Coffee Falling In Love Baking Cookies Pet Names Nicknames Teasing Comfort Minor Violence Getting Together Love Confessions First Kiss

Well, technically, it started with a blue-eyed boy with blonde hair getting screamed at in a language he couldn’t understand when he was only 8 years old. He remembered looking at the boy, who couldn’t be much older than himself - (two weeks older, to be exact, he’d learn later) - and watching the spark disappear right out of those icy blue eyes. That was the first memory Charles Leclerc had of Max Verstappen: Watching Jos Verstappen, Max’s own father, scream at this 8 year old child with an intensity that turned his face red and made every blood vessel in his neck look dangerously close to bursting. But if anyone ever were to ask Charles when he started to realize that his feelings towards that same Max Verstappen he had known since childhood had begun to change into something else, something bigger, something terrifying he couldn’t - or wouldn’t - quite put his finger on, he would say that it all started with a crash.

As he tries to adapt with the new ways of Middle-Earth still the past and its events haunts him while he also has a wayward son who is a constant reminder of his lost beloved. Also the conspiracies in his court to take his crown and the race for the throne continues as the King’s step-brother’s greed grows. Will Miklovand be able to throw aside all the obstacles and claim the throne or will Thranduil eventually see who has been the source of all his miseries? And if he sees will it not be too late to save the only thing he has left? For those who have not read the first part you are welcome to start reading this though I strongly suggest reading the first part first since you would hardly understand anything.,Mature Graphic Depictions Of Violence Major Character Death Rape/Non-Con F/M M/M The Hobbit - All Media Types The Hobbit (Jackson Movies) The Hobbit - J.

That was the first memory Charles Leclerc had of Max Verstappen: Watching Jos Verstappen, Max’s own father, scream at this 8 year old child with an intensity that turned his face red and made every blood vessel in his neck look dangerously close to bursting. But if anyone ever were to ask Charles when he started to realize that his feelings towards that same Max Verstappen he had known since childhood had begun to change into something else, something bigger, something terrifying he couldn’t - or wouldn’t - quite put his finger on, he would say that it all started with a crash. Because of fucking course it did. --- OR: The slow-burn story of Lestappen that has brought me back from the dead, which starts with Max's crash at Silverstone in 2021.

When he looked at John, his friend was already looking at him. And suddenly, it all became clear: He remembered having that conversation more than 50 years ago. He remembered it too well. He had been thinking about it for years, wondering what he should have understood, how he should have reacted. If it was as meaningful as it had felt or if his memory had just romanticized it. “I don’t think a love like that obeys to any rules,” John went on, unaware of Paul’s agitation. “It’s not something that humans have created, not like a societal thing. It’s deeper than that, and that’s what some people are afraid of I guess, because they can’t control it. Whatever laws they create, they can never control it. A white lad will fall in love with a black girl.” He paused. “A lad with another lad. You know.” -- Summer 2019, 77-year-old Paul wakes up feeling surprisingly good.

Geoff, Michael, and Gavin learn that you shouldn't fight against your heart because it wants what it wants. Ryan drags his courtship out for an embarrassing amount of time because he's a gentlemen, before and after Ray presents as an Omega (his Omega), and Ray finds ways to make Ryan comfortable enough to (maybe) become mates. Jack and Lindsay are there for them all. Dan struggles to find his place in all of this, and after a few rough patches he finds a comfortable spot that makes everyone happy. And through all of this, Burnie is suffering through a drastic hormone change. Will he push away and isolate all of his loving friends?

So good in fact that he is the FBI’s favorite undercover guy. He has more undercover operations under his belt than he’d like to remember, and after his latest stint with a ring of human traffickers he really thinks he deserves a break. Unfortunately there’s a new criminal organization on the rise, and all attempts to infiltrate and take down the Padalecki family have failed so far. Which is why Jensen finds himself faced with a new assignment, one that no other agent qualifies for and that he really doesn’t want. Because trying to seduce the most powerful man in the Chicago underworld? Not really high up on his list.

Well, as normal as their lives are allowed to get. Sam relentlessly finds new cases to work, one right after the other; but Dean thinks they need a break to let Cas have some purely human fun, for once. It’s true they had a difficult time readjusting to humanity at first, but Dean thinks Cas deserves to do more than ride around in the back seat and follow them on monster hunts. Then again, Dean’s a little bit scared to ask exactly what Cas would want, just in case it doesn’t include spending quite so much time with him. And with Sam (of course). Sam’s been tracking a series of odd occurrences in Laramie, Wyoming for the last few weeks that looks just enough like a case to finally convince Dean they should go check it out. Whether they like it or not, the goddess responsible for the weirdness in Laramie takes an immediate interest in the three less-than-perfectly-happy hunters who’ve stumbled into her town.",Explicit No Archive Warnings Apply F/M M/M Supernatural Supernatural RPF Castiel/Dean Winchester Genevieve Cortese/Jared Padalecki Jensen Ackles/Misha Collins Dean Winchester Castiel Sam Winchester Jared Padalecki Genevieve Cortese Felicia Day Richard Speight Jr. Community: deancasbigbang Dean/Cas Big Bang Challenge 2015 Case Fic Fake/Pretend Relationship Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence Canon Divergence after 10.20 French Mistake style AU Mutual Pining Fluff Humor Smut Crack Light Angst something for everyone really description of canon-typical violence Supernatural Convention kale - Freeform Dean Winchester and Feelings Human Castiel Switch Dean Switch Castiel First Kiss First Time Frottage Hand Jobs Blow Jobs Shower Sex Anal Fingering Anal Sex Pie AND Cake Enthusiastic Consent Love Confessions
