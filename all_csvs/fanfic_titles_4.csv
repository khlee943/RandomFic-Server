It’s their source of powers as minor deities, after all. Grian, who wanted nothing more than to forget his Watcher past, was quite happy not to be worshipped at all. So when the Hermits collectively started praying to Xelqua and Grian started to gain a lot of Watcher magic, it put a real damper on his mood, health, self-perception and his relationships. With Mumbo gone off-world, it was now up to Scar, Pearl and Xisuma to worry about him – if Grian would let them. But Grian was nothing if not stubborn. He’d get through this alone, right? ..Right?"

A servant of a respected noble family. A survivor, with bruises on his skin and hidden wings tied down to his back. A rebel, sneaking away for a night of wonder in the heart of the kingdom - and a curiosity, gawked at by all as the King himself swept him into his arms and spent hours by his side. When Scar spent days tracking Grian down and helping him escape the cruel grasp of the Watchers, Grian thought his life couldn’t surprise him anymore. Pledging his life to serve Scar was all he could do to thank his King. Of course, being the personal servant of the King comes with its' own risks - and now Grian could add ‘hostage’ to his list of titles. Or; someone decides kidnapping King Scar’s beloved servant was a good idea. It really wasn’t."

They rush forward, eating the distance between them in rapid strides, until they're all crouched around Grian. Grian shuts his eyes again, before remembering he isn't supposed to do that. He wants to say sorry. What he says instead, is: ""It was– safer. Like this. For you."" It amounts to about the same thing. Or, I finally buckle down and post the rough draft of hunger au, where I give Grian every mental illness known to man and also a few new ones. Please heed the tags."

The best part of it was watching Xiao Zhan laugh, too. His laugh was so genuine, coming out from the core of him. When he laughed his whole face lit up, his eyes crinkling, smile bright enough to shine out the sun. And Yibo’s heart just flopped over in his chest. It made him smile and laugh even louder, their laughter infectious. Yibo fell in love with that feeling.

Emperor Philza is always occupied; Tommy hasn’t seen Techno in months, and even if Wilbur is here, their relationship can be described to be strained at best. The royal family doesn’t need to be close, however, it only needs to be balanced, like the pillars holding the country above their heads – as long as they are strong and steady, the Empire will be too. It’s the principle that held Tommy’s back straight and his shoulders broad through the years of hardships and trials of errors; through yet another formal meeting where his father’s gaze would look past him and where his brother’s words would be filled with poison that makes the deepest parts of his soul ache. At that time, Tommy couldn't know that his family would find a replacement for him in the face of a commoner boy named Ranboo. ~🦋~ Tommy's family has replaced him.

Tommy, sixteen, lives with Tubbo in an orphanage, the two of them running around in the cold streets of their town. After a hectic day of getting separated from Tubbo, getting into a few fights, and ending up in an entirely new town, he comes across Phil, and saves him from an assassination attempt by smashing a plate over someone's head. So then both Techno and Wilbur decide to see who this kid is, and Tommy sure is endearing, in the way that the first time they spy on him, he starts a fight in an alleyway over a bag of cookies.

But we want this thing returned to us, and we won’t hesitate to take extreme measures to get what we want.” or, Tommy was a lot of things: a newly debuted hero sidekick, an amnesiac, and a former kidnapping victim of the Syndicate.

Only weeks after his hero debut, the Syndicate announces they are searching for something, and Tommy knows it has to be him. The scariest part? If they find him, Tommy will have no clue what to expect, because the Syndicate might know him, but he has no memories of them. So he can't let them find him. No matter what.

Then again, Dean’s a little bit scared to ask exactly what Cas would want, just in case it doesn’t include spending quite so much time with him. And with Sam (of course). Sam’s been tracking a series of odd occurrences in Laramie, Wyoming for the last few weeks that looks just enough like a case to finally convince Dean they should go check it out. Whether they like it or not, the goddess responsible for the weirdness in Laramie takes an immediate interest in the three less-than-perfectly-happy hunters who’ve stumbled into her town."

Jensen nearly swallows his tongue when hot guy sidles up and says he'll pay double Jensen's going rate if he agrees to leave right the fuck now.

The best part of it was watching Xiao Zhan laugh, too. His laugh was so genuine, coming out from the core of him. When he laughed his whole face lit up, his eyes crinkling, smile bright enough to shine out the sun. And Yibo’s heart just flopped over in his chest. It made him smile and laugh even louder, their laughter infectious. Yibo fell in love with that feeling. That wild joy that came from abandoning whether or not he looked cool and just giving in to the moment. 'I’ll do anything to keep him close to me,' Yibo thought, that very first day."

He fumbled with his binder as he took it, eyes wide as he said, “are you sure? I mean, I love poetry and all, but I don’t think-I’m not sure—what if I can’t write poetry?” Mr. Sam’s dark eyes softened, and he reached out to place a hand on Tommy’s shoulder, squeezing it gently. “Everyone has to start somewhere; every poet, from me to Rudy Francisco, started off without knowing a clue about what we were doing. Tommy, it’s not about if you can or cannot write poetry, it’s about if you want to.” or: The performance poetry AU in which Tommy joins a slam team and finds a home in the arts."

But he gets to work with his idols — Ghostbur, the Blade, and Philza Minecraft, Angel of Death himself, just to name a few — how could he turn down that opportunity, honestly? And keeping his two identities separate can't be that difficult, really. It'll all be a piece of cake. --- or, tommyinnit just wanted to pay the rent and save people at the same time. things can't go his way for just once, can they? ***DISCONTINUED***"
