She did not believe lions were kind, but she always remembered a bow in her schoolgirl hands. She looked in every old wardrobe she came across. It was casual, everyday– the first day in a new lecture hall, she checked the back of the coat closet. Friends had her over for Christmas dinner and she excused herself to go the bathroom, checked every cabinet and closet, and then headed back in for pudding. She went home with a cute boy she met in a smoky little pub and she checked his wardrobe before she headed home the next morning, heels in hand. She also went to college, got a political science degree she had to fight for. She got a byline in the local paper, a few ladies’ magazines, then a larger regional publication. She had mimosa brunches with friends. She read detective novels, never touched fantasy, and finally one day she stepped through an old stone archway barely thinking about it and–- She was standing in a treeless plain, all yellow grass and blue blue skies.

The doting voice of a mother laughs with a toddler as she gently tries to fix a small crown onto the boy's brow. And then there was the gentle voice of a father, that promised to always keep him safe from those who'd do them harm. And in the morning when the boy would awake, he'd wonder who exactly he needed to be protected from. ""Tommy?"" A voice called out from the doorway and Tommy grinned gleefully at the sight of his older brother. ""Dream!"" He yelled, stumbling out of bed and into his arms, hugging the man tight. His brother returned the hug in kind, his hands pressing warmly into the spot on his back where his wings would ignite from for the first time in a few days, fully grown.

At a cost no one can forget, the fight is over—for all but one. Stephen Strange has an idea. An impossible idea spanning dimensions and timelines, life and death, and the lines of good and evil. But he's played impossible odds before—perhaps he never stopped. All that Loki wanted was to fight, one last time, for the fate of his universe.

Or, more accurately, before the boy finds him. Peter Parker has been waiting for the next mission. He just doesn't expect it to come from the future, armed with a ridiculous story demanding a ridiculous quest. And he doesn't expect not to be able to tell Mr. Stark.

Please keep in mind that these stories are extremely varied in kink, tone, and pairings. Some of them are romantic, some of them are hardcore and rough, and one of them literally has a naked Commander Shepard spreading dank memes. So...they're truly a bit of dirty chaos. I've decided to make a separate chapter for each, and the summary is a copy/paste of the actual prompt request that led to me writing it.

Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor’s chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it’s the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He’s lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ’til now - in the blink of an eye, and now he’s stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he’s even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he’s even there would be…20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry’d only be… Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can’t hold him. This is 1988, and Harry’s 23, and alive. Suddenly, being stuck in 1988 doesn’t seem so bad. Or, the one where love means changing the future.

He didn’t know how to explain to Harry – who seemed like he hadn’t been discriminated against a day in his life – that the new Arthur kept giving him what amounted to suicide missions, and that he was currently bleeding out in a warehouse because of the deliberately bad intel she had given him.” Also featuring: Dean is harder to get rid of than Eggsy thought, his mum is going off the deep end, there are way too many nefarious plots in play, and Eggsy is really beginning to wish that Harry would stop holding his hand and kiss him instead.","Explicit Graphic Depictions Of Violence M/M Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015) Harry Hart | Galahad/Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin Harry Hart | Galahad Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin Roxy Morton | Lancelot Merlin (Kingsman) Daisy (Kingsman) Michelle Unwin Dean (Kingsman) Kingsman Agents Past Child Abuse Past Drug Use Slow Burn Spousal Abuse (Off-Screen) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - PTSD Homophobia Suicidal Thoughts"

His hope for a peaceful day-to-day life in limbo goes awry, however, when he meets Queens’ newest hero; a pure-hearted kid with a death wish and a ridiculous pair of red and blue pajamas. The last thing Steve expects when he finally tracks Bucky down is that, not only has the man been living in Queens all this time, right under his nose, but also that, in the two years since they last saw each other, Bucky somehow acquired a kid. Alternatively: How Peter Parker effectively fucks over Bucky Barnes, and also totally saves him.

A few words, sometimes a sentence or even two. The next words their soulmate will say to them. Usually, the first words they'll ever hear from their soulmate. Magnus never got a Soulmark. He's looked. Many times. At first he just assumed it was because of what he was, some byproduct of his freakishness. In his centuries, he's learned differently. Most immortals, most warlocks like him, they get Soulmarks the same time as everyone else. Sometimes they have to wait decades, centuries, to hear those words. Some of them find another Soulmark, decades after living a life with their first. But not Magnus.  Alec has never spoken a word. He can't. In a world where soulmates are connected by Soulmarks that show the first words the other will say to them, he wonders what this means for his soulmate.",Teen And Up Audiences No Archive Warnings Apply M/M Mortal Instruments Series - Cassandra Clare Shadowhunter Chronicles - Cassandra Clare Magnus Bane/Alec Lightwood Alec Lightwood Magnus Bane Jace Lightwood Isabelle Lightwood Soulmates Mute Alec Lightwood Sign Language Muteness Soulmate-Identifying Marks

So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: “ The Batman can fly, you know, I’ve seen his wings.” -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything.",Mature No Archive Warnings Apply M/M Batman - All Media Types Superman - All Media Types DC Extended Universe DCU Clark Kent/Bruce Wayne Dick Grayson & Bruce Wayne Jason Todd & Bruce Wayne Tim Drake & Bruce Wayne Dick Grayson & Jason Todd Tim Drake & Jason Todd Clark Kent Bruce Wayne Dick Grayson Jason Todd Tim Drake Alfred Pennyworth Louis Lane Tim Drake's Parents Diana (Wonder Woman) Damian Wayne Wings Wingfic Adopted Sibling Relationship Sibling Bonding Identity Reveal Secret Identity Headcanon this got out of hand i wanted to write wingfic and failed to do that correctly so now this is a monster Fluff and Humor Fluff and Angst Hurt/Comfort Everyone Needs A Hug Slow Burn Alternate Universe Good Sibling Jason Todd Good Sibling Dick Grayson Good Sibling Tim Drake Alternate Universe - Everyone Lives/Nobody Dies Alternate Universe - Wings But not like you're thinking

They gathered their data through a symbiotic cycle with the local population and were well satisfied with the results. However, a third Entity attacked their Cycle, viewing the system as an aberration. Before being driven off, the one who would come to be known as Abaddon copied their data in the form of a bud. Unfortunately, the principles behind such protocols escaped him, and it was later traded to another known as the Thinker. During a certain accident, the Shard [Queen Administrator] absorbed the data, fascinated by what she found. The potential of such a device was amazing. Now all she needed was a host with attitude!
