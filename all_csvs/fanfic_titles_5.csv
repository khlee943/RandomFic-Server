Bruce comes to his aid, but he finds out that Billy is a 10-year-old homeless orphan with black hair and blue eyes. Obviously, he makes the only logical decision and adopts Billy. Because it's Bruce—who's allergic to revealing life-changing information—the League is left in the dark. This story is written as 5+1 story from the Justice League's POV as they attempt to define the weird relationship between Batman and Captain Marvel. 5 times they didn't realize Batman had adopted Captain Marvel, and the 1 time they did."
Loading and Aspect Ratio,JUBE514,DC Extended Universe,https://archiveofourown.org/works/34977802,"12,783","Summary: So, it didn’t start out like this.  Alfred would scoff at the statement, about how Bruce was trying to justify the whole situation to himself. It had started out as a simple design, black everything with black outlines and black hood. It got a little more intense as the world went on, got wind of his ghost on the streets, and became scared of The Bat . So Bruce got a little more creative with it, Alfred and him had a good laugh over the name, the scare, and Alfred had a vicious streak of humor that he had passed onto his ward-  So now the suit had a visible bat-theme, an insignia to drape in the shadows and to paint across the streets of Gotham.  It only took a year into the whole charade of heroism for Bruce to overhear a conversation between some goons- some low level thug hired by the Riddler this week- about nothing at all pertaining to what the hell the Riddler was doing in the sewers but instead: “ The Batman can fly, you know, I’ve seen his wings.” -- A world where nobody has wings, but people think they do, and that changes everything."

The other League members don't know this is a problem because they have no idea Batman has kids, much less that Nightwing is one of them. Bruce decides to do the only reasonable thing: go on vacation. His children probably won't burn down anything too important. Dick just wants to defend his family and brag about his siblings. Good thing his father taught him a few things about the importance of detailed plans and talented allies."
Of Bats and Robins (and Families),MaskoftheRay,DC Extended Universe,https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031956,"9,672","Summary: “The Justice League knew that there was more to Bruce than he let on. This was to be expected from a man who dressed entirely in black and whose adult life had been partly a lie, so as to maintain a double identity. But they weren't expecting this. Bruce had kids. Like, he even had an honest-to-god child; Damian was going on thirteen this year.” Or, the Justice League meets Bruce's kids (very unofficialy)."

It’s not her fault that she’s excitable, okay, and she forgets things sometimes and maybe those things should not be forgotten under any circumstances. Maybe those things include, well, housing forms, which as it turns out are super important to submit on time if she wants to not be homeless on her sophomore year of college. Her sister’s going to give her so much crap about this. Alternatively: in which Kara forgot to fill out the housing form and was left with no choice but to live in the most exclusive apartment on campus."

A chance for that person to be safe from the destruction that Thanos was about to wrought on Earth. The group about to fight agreed that Peter Parker, for sheer virtual of being the only person not an adult there, would get the dubious honor. Which is how Peter finds himself waking up in Gotham City, a place even crueler and darker than New York City. Peter has to try to find a way to fit into this new universe at just sixteen years old. ""I am still just your butler, and I cannot simply tell you that you will be adopting a new son. But I truly am not getting younger. You have seven children now, even if you haven’t adopted all of them legally. There is much more work than when it was just you and I. There is perhaps too much work for just myself, and then providence dropped a starving young man into my pathway for me to mold into a new generation of caretaker,” Alfred tried to explain himself. Or Alfred finds himself doing the adopting instead of Bruce, this time of a spider. Can Spider-Man become a first rate butler and keep his secret identity?"

Dark Matter,mysterycyclone,DCU,https://archiveofourown.org/works/30153540,"63,082","Summary: The last thing Peter sees is Tony's horrified, heartbroken expression leaning over him. The guilt in his eyes is almost worse than the burning pain that's taking Peter apart piece by piece. The world starts to go dark. There's a flash of gold and green. For one moment, he finds himself standing amongst the Guardians and others. And then darkness again. It feels like blinking; an extended period of nothingness that ends as abruptly as it begins. One moment there’s nothing, the next there’s light. “Easy,” a woman says. Her words are gentle, and carry a slight accent that he can’t place. ""I'm called Wonder Woman. What's your name?"""

Take Care of Business,TheResurrectionist,DCU,https://archiveofourown.org/works/10214285,"27,672","Summary: Summary: Bruce has a conference call with Wayne Enterprises. Having it at the Manor was, in hindsight, a really shitty idea. “I don’t have your phone!” The two boys began trading hits, yelling at the top of their lungs. Bruce turned back to the webcam just as Damian leapt on top of Tim’s back, a high-pitched battle cry torn from his lips. “Mr. Hodges,” he said cheerfully, unflinching as Tim threw Damian into the wet bar sink. “Have you had a chance to examine the chart I pointed out?” Inspired by this viral video and Batwayneman’s post on tumblr."
Bus to Nowhere,foldingfacets,DCU,https://archiveofourown.org/works/40612023,"27,587","Summary: Is it running from your problems if your problems consider you to be a dead imprint of consciousness that killed their son? Yes, but Danny tries not to think about how his nightmares of his parents trying to kill him came true when they found out he was Phantom. After being on the run from his parents and the government for a couple of months, moving from town to town, Danny ends up in Gotham City and decides to risk staying in Batman's territory. He'd take the wrath of Batman over live vivisection via beloved parents or being studied and torn apart by the government. Besides, he's not a meta. Being dead is a medical condition."
Watch This,snackbaskets,DCU,https://archiveofourown.org/works/18942745,"27,423","Summary: Hal and Barry are worried about Batman's new partner. Being around the Batman all the time can't be good for a kid, right? Robin insists otherwise, and for $15.36 of betting money, is happy to demonstrate."

And trying not to become fully dead in the process. The Justice League is very concerned. But it's actually their fault they got involved so take that one, Batman. John Constantine told them not to do the thing. They did it anyway.  Or, Danny gets summoned by the League, and he actually kind of adopts them in the process. Because these big city heroes don't know anything about ghosts and who is he if he doesn't help them out? Besides, the Watchtower is in space. Danny's always wanted to go to space...

A soft melodic voice that sang their mother's lullaby. A more monotonous, but just as loving voice that promised he'd teach him to fight one day, once he was old enough of course. The doting voice of a mother laughs with a toddler as she gently tries to fix a small crown onto the boy's brow. And then there was the gentle voice of a father, that promised to always keep him safe from those who'd do them harm. And in the morning when the boy would awake, he'd wonder who exactly he needed to be protected from. ""Tommy?"" A voice called out from the doorway and Tommy grinned gleefully at the sight of his older brother. ""Dream!"" He yelled, stumbling out of bed and into his arms, hugging the man tight. His brother returned the hug in kind, his hands pressing warmly into the spot on his back where his wings would ignite from for the first time in a few days, fully grown. Surely Dream was all the protection Tommy would ever need in this world, right?

Aliens that pose as statues, and kill their victims by sending them back in time and feeding off their years not lived in the present. The politest psychopaths in the universe, a note reads, scrawled in what looks like a doctor’s chicken scratch on the edge of the page by someone who clearly had a perverse sense of humour. A one way trip, the report concludes; you get transported by the angels, and it’s the slow road back to the present for you. Eggsy lays his head back on the wall, takes stock of his situation. He’s lost 30 years - three years more than his entire lifespan up ’til now - in the blink of an eye, and now he’s stuck here, in 1988. Three years before he’s even born. Arthur, the prick, is sure to be heading up the Kingsmen, and Merlin, if he’s even there would be…20, maybe. Fuck, so fucking young. Shite, even Harry’d only be… Alive, Eggsy thinks, and finds himself sitting down hard from where his knees can’t hold him. This is 1988, and Harry’s 23, and alive. Suddenly, being stuck in 1988 doesn’t seem so bad. Or, the one where love means changing the future. Harry/Eggsy, Time Travel Fix-It."

He had gotten fairly used to it. Didn't mean it was fair, but he knew how these things worked. What really sucked was that the new Arthur was worse than the old one. “Eggsy grimaced. He didn’t know how to explain to Harry – who seemed like he hadn’t been discriminated against a day in his life – that the new Arthur kept giving him what amounted to suicide missions, and that he was currently bleeding out in a warehouse because of the deliberately bad intel she had given him.” Also featuring: Dean is harder to get rid of than Eggsy thought, his mum is going off the deep end, there are way too many nefarious plots in play, and Eggsy is really beginning to wish that Harry would stop holding his hand and kiss him instead."

A villain who was a little less squeamish of blood would have known that. Valentine doesn’t check the body, and Harry lives.
